# Genetic Algorithm for Multi-Knapsack Problem

This repository contains the implementation of a **Genetic Algorithm (GA)** to solve the **Multi-Knapsack Problem** (MKP). The MKP is a combinatorial optimization challenge where items must be distributed into multiple knapsacks without exceeding their capacities while maximizing the total profit.

### Key Features:
- **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: The core algorithm is designed to evolve solutions using selection, crossover, and mutation operations.
- **Two Crossover Versions**:
  - **Multi-Crossover**: Evaluates solutions using a more complex multi-point crossover method.
  - **Single-Crossover**: Employs a simpler, single-point crossover technique.
- **Fitness Evaluation**: Each solution is evaluated based on how well it maximizes the total profit while respecting capacity constraints.
- **Configurable Parameters**: GA parameters, such as population size, crossover type, mutation rate, and number of generations, are adjustable.
- **Comparison of Versions**: The notebook compares two versions of the GA (multi-crossover vs. single-crossover) and visualizes their performance over multiple iterations.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculates the mean and standard deviation of the fitness values for both versions, providing insight into the consistency of the solutions.

### Usage:
The project uses a sample input file (`multi_knap_n40_m5.txt`), containing:
- `n`: number of items
- `m`: number of knapsacks
- `profits`: profits for each item
- `res`: the weight/resource matrix for each item
- `cap`: the capacity of each knapsack

The algorithm runs for a user-defined number of iterations, tracking and comparing the performance of the two crossover methods.

### Example Output:
- **Fitness Values**: For each iteration, the algorithm records the best solutions found and their corresponding fitness values.
- **Performance Graphs**: Visualizes how both versions of the GA improve their solutions over time.

### Dependencies:
- **Python 3**
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and fitness calculations.
- **Matplotlib**: For plotting the comparison graphs.

### How to Run:
1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed (`NumPy`, `Matplotlib`).
2. Run the notebook and visualize the genetic algorithm's performance on the MKP using different crossover strategies.
3. Modify the GA parameters as needed to explore different optimization behaviors.
