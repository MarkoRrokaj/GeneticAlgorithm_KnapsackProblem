# genetic_algorithm_knapsack
This project implements a Genetic Algorithm to solve the Multi-Knapsack Problem (MKP). It features two crossover methods (multi-crossover and single-crossover) and evaluates their performance. The notebook includes configurable parameters, fitness evaluation, and visualizations of results using sample input data.
